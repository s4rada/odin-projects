    <h1>The French Toast</h1>
    <img src="https://sugarspunrun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/French-Toast-recipe-1-of-1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>6 thick slices bread</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt together in a shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Lightly butter a griddle or skillet and heat over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Dunk bread in the egg mixture, soaking both sides.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the hot skillet and cook until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>

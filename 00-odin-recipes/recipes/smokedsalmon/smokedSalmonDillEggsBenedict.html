    <p>Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict with Mustard-Dill Sauce is a scrumptious, lighter version of traditional Eggs Benedict. Plus, the sauce is much easier to prepare than Hollandaise!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh dill</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 English muffins, split and toasted</li>
        <li>4 ounces sliced smoked salmon</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 small fresh dill sprigs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir butter, dill, lemon zest, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until combined. <br> Set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar and a pinch of salt. Crack an egg into a bowl then gently slip the egg into the water. Repeat with remaining eggs. Poach eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, then transfer to a warm plate.</li>
        <li>Generously spread each English muffin half with dill butter. Top with a layer of smoked salmon, then 1 poached egg. Season with cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to taste. Garnish with a dill sprig and serve.</li>
    </ol>
